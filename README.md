# gis-lagefaktor

## Usage

    ```bash
    python3 lagefaktor.py PROJECT_NAME
    ```

    where `PROJECT_NAME` is the name of the project. The script will look for the input shape files in the `DATA/PROJECT_NAME` directory and write the output shape files to the `DATA/PROJECT_NAME/output` directory. If any of the input directories are missing, the script will create them. PROJECT_NAME has to exist, however. All you need to do is to put the input shape files in the correct directories and PROJECT_NAME after you run the script for the first time. Add the shape files to the correct directories and run the script again.

    Again, the steps are:
    1. Create a directory `DATA/PROJECT_NAME`
    2. Run the script with `PROJECT_NAME` as the argument
    3. Add the input shape files to the correct directories
    4. Run the script again

## Input shape files

### Directory structure

DATA/Project Name
|
+-- changing
|
+-- compensatory
|
+-- construction
|
+-- protected
|
+-- interference
|
+-- scope
|
+-- unchanging
|
+-- output
|
+-- debug

### changing

Shapefiles that define areas that are part of the planned development

### compensatory

Shapefiles that define areas that are part of the compensatory measures

### construction

Shapefiles that define areas that are part of the construction areas

### unchanging

Shapefiles that define areas that are not part of the planned development. This is optional. If they cover construction or compensatory areas, those parts will be removed from the calculations and the output shapes.

### protected

Shapefiles that define areas that are part of the protected areas such as nature reserves

### interference

Shapefiles that define areas that are part of the interference areas are used to calculate the interference factors as part of the Lagefaktor calculations for the construction areas

### scope

Shapefiles that define the scope of the planned development. This is optional. If it is not provided, the scope is calculated as the union of the changing, compensatory and construction areas.

## Output shape files

### output

The output directory contains the compensatory and construction shapes with all relevant calculations.

### debug

The debug directory contains debug shape files that are used to visualize the intermediate results of the calculations.
